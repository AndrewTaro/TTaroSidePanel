# TTaro Team Panel
The mod supports almost all the features that the traditional team panels have.  
You can personalize it to be the simplest team panel, or the most info-flooded one.

- Each element can be separately shown/hidden.
- You can set the ship stats (such as torpedo range, radar range, etc) to be visible only when you press the ALT key. So that they no longer occupy half of the screen for an entire battle!
- The ship stats include the airstrike range, range of alternative torpedo, AA range, underwater speed, air detection, etc. which were often not present in the existing mods.
- Hovering the mouse on the player allows you to check the detailed stats of the ship. For example, Main gun DPM, the number of AA bubbles, and Depth charge parameters.
- When Regen Monitor is installed, the HP bar also reflects the regeneratable HP of your allies.
- (Technical aspect): The mod is built with Unbound2 technology, which is a better framework in terms of maintenance, performance, and code-readability compared to Unbound1 which the current panels are using.

# Overview

![Or you can display everything at once. Even then you are still able to hide them while Alt key is not pressed!](https://github.com/AndrewTaro/TTaroTeamPanel/assets/36262823/b6577fe1-a8d8-4139-8dfc-ad14bfb6ebb8)

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive and you should get `gui`, `PnFMods` folders, and `PnFModsLoader.py`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/gui/unbound2/mods/ttaro_teampanel.unbound`
4. Done!
